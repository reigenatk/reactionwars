A 1v1 reaction game in SocketIO

Have you ever wondered how fast your reaction time was? Better yet, have you ever wondered how it stacks up against others? Perhaps a friend of yours? Well look no further.
By going to [Reaction Wars](https://reactionwarsv1.herokuapp.com/) you can fight your friend in an epic 1v1 reaction time battle. Figure out who has the faster
reaction time and have a bit of friendly competition!

I made this project using a NodeJS/Express backend, and a good dose of vanilla JS + JQuery for UI rendering. 
To enable real time communication, I used the [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) library.

To play, simply enter a username and a room, if the room doesn't exist then it will be created.

 Please enjoy and let me know if there are any bugs!
